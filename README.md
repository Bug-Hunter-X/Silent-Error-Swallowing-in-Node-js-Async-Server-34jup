# Silent Error Swallowing in Node.js Async Server

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle bug in Node.js servers that handle asynchronous operations: silently swallowing errors.  When an error occurs within an asynchronous function, the server might not respond appropriately to the client, making debugging difficult.

The `bug.js` file showcases the problematic code. The `bugSolution.js` demonstrates how to fix the issue.

## Problem

The server doesn't handle errors thrown within the asynchronous `someAsyncOperation` function. If `somePromiseThatMightReject` rejects, the error is logged to the console but not sent as an appropriate error response to the client. This makes it hard to diagnose problems in production.

## Solution

The solution involves properly handling the rejected promise within the asynchronous function. This involves sending an error response to the client with an appropriate status code.
